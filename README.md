CloudUploader-CLI
A simple command-line tool to upload files to popular cloud storage services: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage. Whether you’re automating a process or need a quick solution, CloudUploader-CLI is designed to simplify your file upload tasks.

Motivation
I built CloudUploader-CLI to streamline file uploads to cloud platforms directly from the terminal. As a developer, I wanted a fast, reliable, and simple tool that could handle cloud file management in my CI/CD pipeline, without dealing with complex API integrations or heavyweight libraries. It’s designed to be minimalistic but powerful enough to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing friction in cloud workflows.

Why Build This Project?
In many automation setups, uploading files to cloud storage is a recurring task. By building CloudUploader-CLI, I could simplify this process, focusing on clean, easy-to-use functionality for developers and sysadmins. Instead of navigating complex UIs or dealing with cumbersome scripts, this tool provides a straightforward way to upload files to cloud storage from the command line.
